"""Q1: Describe how you would start building out code to accomplish this task? What functions, statements, or keywords would you need to use? How would you start to organize this program?"""



"""Q2: See where you can get with writing this program. What parts of the program were you able to get working? Where did you run into challenges?"""



"""Q3: How does the sample program compare to your approach to the previous two questions? What was similar? What was different? How are you thinking differently (if at all) about how to approach this type of program?"""



"""Q4: How would you write a program that calls the function you have created? Include code + comments."""




"""Q5: Write a function is_even that determines whether or not a number n is even. Include code + comments for the function definition as well as a sample function call."""




"""Q6: Write a function average that determines the average value of a list. Include code + comments for the function definition as well as a sample function call."""




"""Q7: Write a function uniq that takes a list and returns a new list containing only unique values. Include code + comments for the function definition as well as a sample function call."""




"""Q8: The Python code below is suppose to create a function that determines if the given list of numbers is sorted. That is, the function should return True if each item in the list is less than the next item. Unfortunately, there are a few errors in the code below. Identify the errors and fix the code. Include your modified code with comments that document what changes you made to address the errors.
