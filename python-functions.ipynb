    "1. In Python, a function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation.\n",
    "- Key term: *function*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To execute a function, we call it by name and pass it an appropriate set of input arguments.\n",
    "- Key terms: *function call, input argument*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A function takes zero or more arguments as inputs and returns zero or more outputs as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The output or result of a function is called the return value.\n",
    "- Key terms: *function output or return value*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data, parameters, or arguments can be passed into a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Functions can also return data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Built-In Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "7. We have actually already been working with a number of Python's built-in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. These include `print()`, `dict()`, `input()`, `int()`, and `len()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. We call built-in functions using the function name, followed by parenthesis.\n",
    "- `print()`\n",
    "- `dict()`\n",
    "- `input()`\n",
    "- `int()`\n",
    "- `len()`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Named Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "10. But Python also allows you to create (and name) your own functions.\n",
    "- Key term: *named function(s)*\n",
    "\n",
    "11. We can define or name a function using the `def` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. A function definition includes a few core components:\n",
    "- The name of the new function\n",
    "- The list of function arguments\n",
    "- The sequence of statements to execute when the function is called\n",
    "\n",
    "13. The core syntax for defining your own function:\n"

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "14. Let's unpack each of those components.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. `def function_name()` is the name you are giving to the function you create- this is the header for the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Function names have many of the same rules as variable names- no spaces or special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. `argument` is the argument that will be passed to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. When we are initially defining the function, the `argument` value is typically a placeholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Later in the program when we call the named function, the argument being passed to the function goes in these parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. The nested or indented line `statement(s)` is the body of the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. It includes a sequence of statements to execute when the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. The nested or indented line `return result` is a placeholder for the function output or endpoint- it is also part of the body of the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Named Functions Work\n",
    "\n",
    "23. So what happens when we use the `def` keyword to create a named function?\n",
    "\n",
    "24. Programs are always executed sequentially, one statement at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. Function definitions create new functions, but do not execute the bodies or statements within the functions UNTIL the functions are called.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. When we call a named function, the program jumps to the definition for the function being called, executes the function's body, and then returns to the point in the program where the function was called and resumes executing the program.\n",

    "- Key term: *void function(s)*\n",

That is, the function should return True if each item in the list is less than the next item. Unfortunately, there are a few errors in the code below. Identify the errors and fix the code. Include your modified code with comments that document what changes you made to address the errors."
